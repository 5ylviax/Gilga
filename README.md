In Gilga, the core mechanics focus on survival through movement, shooting, and managing enemy threats. Enemies spawn at random positions on the platform, and both the player and enemies are restricted to this shared space. The player must shoot each enemy five times to eliminate them, creating a clear rule for combat. A key challenge is avoiding two types of enemy projectiles; one that can be destroyed by the player’s projectile and one that is indestructible, requiring the player to dodge instead of counterattacking. These mechanics create a loop of positioning, aiming, and quick decision-making as the player progresses through increasingly difficult levels.
